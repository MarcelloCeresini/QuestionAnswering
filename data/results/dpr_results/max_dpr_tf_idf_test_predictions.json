The right tool for understanding the world outside of the Bible for Luther is none other than reason, which for him is the field of science, philosophy, history and empirical observation.

Its most familiar effect is beta decay (of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity. The word \"weak\" derives from the fact that the field strength is some 1013 times less than that of the strong force. Still, it is stronger than gravity over short distances. A consistent electroweak theory has also been developed, which shows that electromagnetic forces and the weak force are indistinguishable at a temperatures in excess of approximately 1015 kelvins", "573796edc3c5551400e51f37": "color confinement", "57379829c3c5551400e51f3d": "free-market economy", "57379829c3c5551400e51f3e": "free-market economy", "57379829c3c5551400e51f3f": "(of neutrons in atomic nuclei) and the associated radioactivity", "57379829c3c5551400e51f40": "1013", "57379829c3c5551400e51f41": "very short distances", "57379a4b1c456719005744cd": "The normal force", "57379a4b1c456719005744ce": "Pauli repulsion", "57379a4b1c456719005744cf": "electromagnetic force", "57379a4b1c456719005744d0": "electromagnetic force", "57379ed81c456719005744d5": "compression, and drag", "57379ed81c456719005744d6": "two people are pulling on the same rope", "57379ed81c456719005744d7": "instantaneously in action-reaction pairs", "57379ed81c456719005744d8": "each pivoting divides the list in half", "57379ed81c456719005744d9": "By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object through the use of a set-up that uses movable pulleys", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f47": "the bodies were accelerated by gravity to an extent that was independent of their mass and argued that objects retain their velocity", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f48": "largest age difference between opposing Super Bowl quarterbacks at 13 years and 48 days (Manning was 39, Newton was 26).", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f49": "microscopic potentials", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f4a": "crashing into an immobile surface", "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f4b": "quantized\", i.e. they appear in discrete portions", "5737a25ac3c5551400e51f51": "broken circles", "5737a25ac3c5551400e51f52": "unit vector pointing in the radial direction outwards from the center.
