This teaching by Luther was clearly expressed in his 1525 publication On the Bondage of the Will, which was written in response to On Free Will by Desiderius Erasmus (1524). Luther based his position on predestination on St. Paul's epistle to the Ephesians 2:8\u201310. Against the teaching of his day that the righteous acts of believers are performed in cooperation with God, Luther wrote that Christians receive such righteousness entirely from outside themselves; that righteousness not only comes from Christ but actually is the righteousness of Christ, imputed to Christians (rather than infused into them) through faith. \"That is why faith alone makes someone just and fulfills the law,\" he wrote. \"Faith is that which brings the Holy Spirit through the merits of Christ", "56f7fde8a6d7ea1400e1736b": "faith alone, whether fiduciary or dogmatic, cannot justify man; justification rather depends only on such faith as is active in charity and good works", "56f7ffadaef2371900625d5e": "31 October 1517", "56f7ffadaef2371900625d5f": "Martin Luther", "56f7ffadaef2371900625d60": "The Ninety-Five Theses", "56f7ffadaef2371900625d61": "Roland Bainton", "56f7ffadaef2371900625d62": "Thesis 86", "56f80143aef2371900625d68": "Johann Tetzel", "56f80143aef2371900625d69": "\"As soon as the coin in the coffer rings, the soul from purgatory (also attested as 'into heaven') springs.\"", "56f80143aef2371900625d6a": "Luther", "56f80143aef2371900625d6b": "Johann Tetzel", "56f802c6a6d7ea1400e17377": "God's alone to grant, those who claimed that indulgences absolved buyers from all punishments and granted them salvation were in error.

Although the traditional Chinese elite were not given their share of power, the Mongols and the Semuren (various allied groups from Central Asia and the western end of the empire) largely remained strangers to the mainstream Chinese culture, and this dichotomy gave the Yuan regime a somewhat strong \"colonial\" coloration. The unequal treatment is possibly due to the fear of transferring power to the ethnic Chinese under their rule. The Mongols and Semuren were given certain advantages in the dynasty, and this would last even after the restoration of the imperial examination in the early 14th century.

As a result of increasing land clearance (Bronze Age agriculture), in the upland areas (central Germany), the sediment load of the Rhine has strongly increased and delta growth has sped up. This caused increased flooding and sedimentation, ending peat formation in the delta. The shifting of river channels to new locations, on the floodplain (termed avulsion), was the main process distributing sediment across the subrecent delta. Over the past 6000 years, approximately 80 avulsions have occurred.
