The United Methodist Church believes in prima scriptura, seeing the Holy Bible as the primary authority in the Church and using sacred tradition, reason, and experience to interpret it, with the aid of the Holy Spirit (see Wesleyan Quadrilateral). Therefore, according to The Book of Discipline, United Methodist theology is at once \"catholic, evangelical, and reformed.\" Today, the UMC is generally considered one of the more moderate and tolerant denominations with respect to race, gender, and ideology, though the denomination itself actually includes a very wide spectrum of attitudes. Comparatively, the UMC stands to the right of liberal and progressive Protestant groups such as the United Church of Christ and the Episcopal Church on certain issues (especially regarding sexuality), but to the left of historically conservative evangelical traditions such as the Southern Baptists and Pentecostalism", "56e77c6737bdd419002c401d": "LDS Church", "56e77c6737bdd419002c401e": "a trusted friend", "56e77c6737bdd419002c401f": "spiritual mentorship", "56e77c6737bdd419002c4020": "husband and father", "56e77c6737bdd419002c4021": "General Conference", "56e77cee00c9c71400d771a8": "a Lama", "56e77cee00c9c71400d771a9": "extremely high", "56e77cee00c9c71400d771aa": "their disciples", "56e77cee00c9c71400d771ab": "the West", "56e77da237bdd419002c403b": "a Lama", "56e77da237bdd419002c403c": "be reborn", "56e77da237bdd419002c403d": "Tulku", "56e77da237bdd419002c403e": "many times", "56e77da237bdd419002c403f": "phowa and siddhi", "56e77e4a00c9c71400d771b0": "ulemas", "56e77e4a00c9c71400d771b1": "ulemas", "56e77e4a00c9c71400d771b2": "Sufism", "56e77e4a00c9c71400d771b3": "Goldbach's conjecture (that every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes), and the twin prime conjecture (that there are infinitely many pairs of primes whose difference is 2).

Prior to the early 1960s, access to the forest's interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. Farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. However, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion.
