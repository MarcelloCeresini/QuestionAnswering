In these early years the practical use of the collection was very much emphasised as opposed to that of \"High Art\" at the National Gallery and scholarship at the British Museum. George Wallis (1811\u20131891), the first Keeper of Fine Art Collection, passionately promoted the idea of wide art education through the museum collections. This led to the transfer to the museum of the School of Design that had been founded in 1837 at Somerset House; after the transfer it was referred to as the Art School or Art Training School, later to become the Royal College of Art", "57269e3bf1498d1400e8e51a": "lowing a", "57269f3ef1498d1400e8e534": "courts can also require specific performance or will grant an injunction", "57269f3ef1498d1400e8e535": "incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons", "57269f3ef1498d1400e8e536": "set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages", "57269f3ef1498d1400e8e537": "6 million Lira", "5726a00cf1498d1400e8e550": "European Court of Justice", "5726a00cf1498d1400e8e551": "fundamental rights (see human rights), proportionality, legal certainty, equality before the law and subsidiarity", "5726a09f708984140094cc39": "since the 1950s", "5726a09f708984140094cc3a": "Article 5", "5726a09f708984140094cc3b": "the least onerous", "5726a14c708984140094cc51": "since the 1960s", "5726a14c708984140094cc52": "the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)", "5726a14c708984140094cc53": "automatically void", "5726a14c708984140094cc54": "legal certainty and good faith", "5726a1e5dd62a815002e8b86": "constitutional traditions common to the member states", "5726a1e5dd62a815002e8b87": "the Treaties allowed citizens or corporations to bring claims against EU and member state institutions for violation of the Treaties and Regulations", "5726a299dd62a815002e8b9e": "\"international", "5726a299dd62a815002e8b9f": "European Community", "5726a299dd62a815002e8ba0": "the 1970s", "5726a299dd62a815002e8ba1": "UNICE, the employers' confederation, the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) and CEEP, the European Centre of Public Enterprises", "5726a299dd62a815002e8ba2": "1989 Strasbourg European Council", "5726a34bf1498d1400e8e59e": "the Treaty of Rome 1957", "5726a34bf1498d1400e8e59f": "Fundamental rights", "5726a34bf1498d1400e8e5a0": "European Union law", "5726a34bf1498d1400e8e5a1": "European Court of Justice", "5726a3c6f1498d1400e8e5ae": "1997 Treaty of Amsterdam", "5726a3c6f1498d1400e8e5af": "1763, and war in the European theatre of the Seven Years' War was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763", "5726a3c6f1498d1400e8e5b0": "in 1989", "5726a3c6f1498d1400e8e5b1": "30 general principles", "5726a3c6f1498d1400e8e5b2": "40 pieces", "5726a46cdd62a815002e8bd0": "11 of the then 12", "5726a46cdd62a815002e8bd1": "The UK", "5726a46cdd62a815002e8bd2": "The Social Chapter is a chapter of the 1997 Treaty of Amsterdam", "5726a46cdd62a815002e8bd3": "1763, and war in the European theatre of the Seven Years' War was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763", "5726a5525951b619008f78dd": "refused to sign the Social Charter and was exempt from the legislation covering Social Charter issues unless it agreed to be bound by the legislation", "5726a5525951b619008f78de": "Following the election of the UK Labour Party to government in 1997", "5726a5525951b619008f78df": "73/173/EEC", "5726a5525951b619008f78e0": "73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963", "5726a5525951b619008f78e1": "workforce consultation in businesses", "5726a638dd62a815002e8bf6": "France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Germany", "5726a638dd62a815002e8bf7": "1951 following the second World War.

The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not.

The Court of Justice, giving \"horizontal\" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance of acquiring the certificate, and because it was \"impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means\", the measure was disproportionate.

Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component.
