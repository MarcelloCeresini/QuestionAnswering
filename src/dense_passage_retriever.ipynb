    "In this notebook, we will try to implement the architecture detailed in [Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906.pdf). \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that we have a corpus of documents $C = {p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_M}$ where each passage $p_i$ can be viewed as a sequence of tokens $w_1^{(i)}, w_2^{(i)}, \\dots, w_{|p_i|}^{(i)}$ and given a question $q$ we want to find the sequence of tokens $w_s^{(i)}, w_{s+1}^{(i)}, \\dots, w_{e}^{(i)}$ from one of the passage $i$ that can answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the passage $i$ we need an efficient **Retriever** (i.e. a function $R: (q, C) \\rightarrow C_F$ where $C_F$ is a very small set of $k$ documents that have a high correlation with the query.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Tf-Idf example, the retriever was simply a function that returned the top 5 scores obtained by computing the vector cosine similarity between the query and all other documents. The problem with this approach is that it is not very efficient. Tf-Idf is a **sparse** document/query representation, thus computing a multitude of dot products between these very long vectors can be expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "The paper cited above proposes a **dense** representation instead. It uses a Dense Encoder $E_P$ which maps all paragraphs to $d$-dimensional vectors. These vectors are stored in a database so that they can be efficiently retrieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "At run-time, another Dense Encoder is used $E_Q$ which maps the input question to a vector with the same dimensionality $d$. Then, a similarity score is computed between the two representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$sim(p,q) = E_Q(q)^\\intercal E_P(p)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the paper, $E_Q$ and $E_P$ are two independent BERT transformers and the $d$-dimensional vector is the **output at the $\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token** (so, $d = 768$).\n",
    "- This leaves open the possibility to use a larger dimensionality (eg. concatenating the output at multiple blocks like we did for the QA task).\n",
    "\n",
    "The $d$-dimensional representations of the $M$ passages are indexed using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), an efficient, open-source library for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors developed at Facebook AI. At run-time, we simply compute $v_q = E_Q(q)$ and retrieve the top $k$ passages with embeddings closest to $v_q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, training the network means solving a **metric learning** problem: the two BERT networks need to learn an **effective vector space** such that relevant pairs of questions and passages are close, while irrelevant pairs are placed further away. In this problem we usually build a **training instance $D$** as ${(q_i, p_i^+, p_{i,1}^-, p_{i,2}^-, \\dots, p_{i,n}^-)}^m_{i=1}$, where question $q$ is paired with a relevant (positive) passage $p_i^+$ and $n$ irrelevant (negative) passages. Then, the loss function is the negative log-likelihood of the positive passage:\n",
    "\n",
    "$L(q_i, p_i^+, p_{i,1}^-, p_{i,2}^-, \\dots, p_{i,n}^-) = -\\log\\frac{e^{sim(q_i, p_i^+)}}{e^{sim(q_i, p_i^+)} + \\sum_{j=1}^n e^{sim(q_i, p_{i,j}^-)}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to find the positive paragraph, but choosing the negatives is quite important. In particular, the paper proposes different ways for sampling the negatives:\n",
    "- Random: a negative is any random passage in the corpus\n",
    "- TF-IDF (The paper uses a variant, BM25): the negatives are the top passages (not containing the answer) returned by a TF-IDF search\n",
    "- Gold: the negatives are positives for other questions in the mini-batch. For the researchers, this is the best negative-mining option, because it's the most efficient and also it makes a batch a complete unit of learning (we learn the relationship that each question in the batch has with the other paragraphs).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gold method allows the **in-batch negatives** technique: assuming to have a batch size of $B$, then we collect two $B \\times d$ matrices (one for questions, one for their positive paragraphs). Then, we compute $S = QP^\\intercal$ which is a $B \\times B$ matrix of **similarity scored** between each question and paragraph. This matrix can directly be used for training: any ($q_i, p_j$) pais where $i = j$ is considered to be a positive example, while it's negative otherwise. In total there will be $B$ training instances per batch, each with $B-1$ negative passages. "
