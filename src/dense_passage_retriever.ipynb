        "In this notebook, we will try to implement the architecture detailed in [Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906.pdf). \n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is that we have a corpus of documents $C = {p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_M}$ where each passage $p_i$ can be viewed as a sequence of tokens $w_1^{(i)}, w_2^{(i)}, \\dots, w_{|p_i|}^{(i)}$ and given a question $q$ we want to find the sequence of tokens $w_s^{(i)}, w_{s+1}^{(i)}, \\dots, w_{e}^{(i)}$ from one of the passage $i$ that can answer the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to find the passage $i$ we need an efficient **Retriever** (i.e. a function $R: (q, C) \\rightarrow C_F$ where $C_F$ is a very small set of $k$ documents that have a high correlation with the query.)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Tf-Idf example, the retriever was simply a function that returned the top 5 scores obtained by computing the vector cosine similarity between the query and all other documents. The problem with this approach is that it is not very efficient. Tf-Idf is a **sparse** document/query representation, thus computing a multitude of dot products between these very long vectors can be expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper cited above proposes a **dense** representation instead. It uses a Dense Encoder $E_P$ which maps all paragraphs to $d$-dimensional vectors. These vectors are stored in a database so that they can be efficiently retrieved. \n",
        "\n",
        "At run-time, another Dense Encoder is used $E_Q$ which maps the input question to a vector with the same dimensionality $d$. Then, a similarity score is computed between the two representations:\n",
        "\n",
        "$sim(p,q) = E_Q(q)^\\intercal E_P(p)$\n",
        "\n",
        "In the paper, $E_Q$ and $E_P$ are two independent BERT transformers and the $d$-dimensional vector is the **output at the $\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token** (so, $d = 768$).\n",
        "- This leaves open the possibility to use a larger dimensionality (eg. concatenating the output at multiple blocks like we did for the QA task).\n",
        "\n",
        "The $d$-dimensional representations of the $M$ passages are indexed using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), an efficient, open-source library for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors developed at Facebook AI. At run-time, we simply compute $v_q = E_Q(q)$ and retrieve the top $k$ passages with embeddings closest to $v_q$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, training the network means solving a **metric learning** problem: the two BERT networks need to learn an **effective vector space** such that relevant pairs of questions and passages are close, while irrelevant pairs are placed further away. In this problem we usually build a **training instance $D$** as ${(q_i, p_i^+, p_{i,1}^-, p_{i,2}^-, \\dots, p_{i,n}^-)}^m_{i=1}$, where question $q$ is paired with a relevant (positive) passage $p_i^+$ and $n$ irrelevant (negative) passages. Then, the loss function is the negative log-likelihood of the positive passage:\n",
        "\n",
        "$L(q_i, p_i^+, p_{i,1}^-, p_{i,2}^-, \\dots, p_{i,n}^-) = -\\log\\frac{e^{sim(q_i, p_i^+)}}{e^{sim(q_i, p_i^+)} + \\sum_{j=1}^n e^{sim(q_i, p_{i,j}^-)}}$\n",
        "\n",
        "It's easy to find the positive paragraph, but choosing the negatives is quite important. In particular, the paper proposes different ways for sampling the negatives:\n",
        "- Random: a negative is any random passage in the corpus\n",
        "- TF-IDF (The paper uses a variant, BM25): the negatives are the top passages (not containing the answer) returned by a TF-IDF search\n",
        "- Gold: the negatives are positives for other questions in the mini-batch. For the researchers, this is the best negative-mining option, because it's the most efficient and also it makes a batch a complete unit of learning (we learn the relationship that each question in the batch has with the other paragraphs).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Gold method allows the **in-batch negatives** technique: assuming to have a batch size of $B$, then we collect two $B \\times d$ matrices (one for questions, one for their positive paragraphs). Then, we compute $S = QP^\\intercal$ which is a $B \\times B$ matrix of **similarity scored** between each question and paragraph. This matrix can directly be used for training: any ($q_i, p_j$) pais where $i = j$ is considered to be a positive example, while it's negative otherwise. In total there will be $B$ training instances per batch, each with $B-1$ negative passages. "

But official calendars preserved from different times and places also show a flexibility in omitting or expanding events, indicating that there was no single static and authoritative calendar of required observances. In the later Empire under Christian rule, the new Christian festivals were incorporated into the existing framework of the Roman calendar, alongside at least some of the traditional festivals.\n",
            "1)\tRoman calendars show roughly forty annual religious festivals. Some lasted several days, others a single day or less: sacred days (dies fasti) outnumbered \"non-sacred\" days (dies nefasti). A comparison of surviving Roman religious calendars suggests that official festivals were organized according to broad seasonal groups that allowed for different local traditions. Some of the most ancient and popular festivals incorporated ludi (\"games,\" such as chariot races and theatrical performances), with examples including those held at Palestrina in honour of Fortuna Primigenia during Compitalia, and the Ludi Romani in honour of Liber. Other festivals may have required only the presence and rites of their priests and acolytes, or particular groups, such as women at the Bona Dea rites.\n",
            "2)\tWhile forming an integral part of the Christian calendar, particularly in Catholic regions, many Carnival traditions resemble those antedating Christianity. Italian Carnival is sometimes thought to be derived from the ancient Roman festivals of Saturnalia and Bacchanalia. The Saturnalia, in turn, may be based on the Greek Dionysia and Oriental festivals. For the start of the Roman Saturnalia, on December 17 authorities chose an enemy of the Roman people to represent the Lord of Misrule in each community. These men and women were forced to indulge in food and physical pleasures throughout the week, horribly murdered on December 25th: \"destroying the forces of darkness\".\n",
            "3)\tOther public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part.\n",
            "4)\tThe Romans are known for the great number of deities they honored, a capacity that earned the mockery of early Christian polemicists. The presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury.\n"
