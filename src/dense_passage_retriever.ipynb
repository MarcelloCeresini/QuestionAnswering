        "In this notebook, we will try to implement the architecture detailed in [Dense Passage Retrieval for Open-Domain Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.04906.pdf). \n",
        "\n",
        "The idea is that we have a corpus of documents $C = {p_1, p_2, \\dots, p_M}$ where each passage $p_i$ can be viewed as a sequence of tokens $w_1^{(i)}, w_2^{(i)}, \\dots, w_{|p_i|}^{(i)}$ and given a question $q$ we want to find the sequence of tokens $w_s^{(i)}, w_{s+1}^{(i)}, \\dots, w_{e}^{(i)}$ from one of the passage $i$ that can answer the question.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to find the passage $i$ we need an efficient **Retriever** (i.e. a function $R: (q, C) \\rightarrow C_F$ where $C_F$ is a very small set of $k$ documents that have a high correlation with the query.)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the Tf-Idf example, the retriever was simply a function that returned the top 5 scores obtained by computing the vector cosine similarity between the query and all other documents. The problem with this approach is that it is not very efficient. Tf-Idf is a **sparse** document/query representation, thus computing a multitude of dot products between these very long vectors can be expensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "The paper cited above proposes a **dense** representation instead. It uses a Dense Encoder $E_P$ which maps all paragraphs to $d$-dimensional vectors. These vectors are stored in a database so that they can be efficiently retrieved. \n",
        "\n",
        "At run-time, another Dense Encoder is used $E_Q$ which maps the input question to a vector with the same dimensionality $d$. Then, a similarity score is computed between the two representations:\n",
        "\n",
        "$sim(p,q) = E_Q(q)^\\intercal E_P(p)$\n",
        "\n",
        "In the paper, $E_Q$ and $E_P$ are two independent BERT transformers and the $d$-dimensional vector is the **output at the $\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token** (so, $d = 768$).\n",
        "- This leaves open the possibility to use a larger dimensionality (eg. concatenating the output at multiple blocks like we did for the QA task).\n",
        "\n",
        "The $d$-dimensional representations of the $M$ passages are indexed using [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss), an efficient, open-source library for similarity search and clustering of dense vectors developed at Facebook AI. At run-time, we simply compute $v_q = E_Q(q)$ and retrieve the top $k$ passages with embeddings closest to $v_q$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this case, training the network means solving a **metric learning** problem: the two BERT networks need to learn an **effective vector space** such that relevant pairs of questions and passages are close, while irrelevant pairs are placed further away. In this problem we usually build a **training instance $D$** as ${(q_i, p_i^+, p_{i,1}^-, p_{i,2}^-, \\dots, p_{i,n}^-)}^m_{i=1}$, where question $q$ is paired with a relevant (positive) passage $p_i^+$ and $n$ irrelevant (negative) passages. Then, the loss function is the negative log-likelihood of the positive passage:\n",
        "\n",
        "$L(q_i, p_i^+, p_{i,1}^-, p_{i,2}^-, \\dots, p_{i,n}^-) = -\\log\\frac{e^{sim(q_i, p_i^+)}}{e^{sim(q_i, p_i^+)} + \\sum_{j=1}^n e^{sim(q_i, p_{i,j}^-)}}$\n",
        "\n",
        "It's easy to find the positive paragraph, but choosing the negatives is quite important. In particular, the paper proposes different ways for sampling the negatives:\n",
        "- Random: a negative is any random passage in the corpus\n",
        "- TF-IDF (The paper uses a variant, BM25): the negatives are the top passages (not containing the answer) returned by a TF-IDF search\n",
        "- Gold: the negatives are positives for other questions in the mini-batch. For the researchers, this is the best negative-mining option, because it's the most efficient and also it makes a batch a complete unit of learning (we learn the relationship that each question in the batch has with the other paragraphs).\n",
        "\n",
        "The Gold method allows the **in-batch negatives** technique: assuming to have a batch size of $B$, then we collect two $B \\times d$ matrices (one for questions, one for their positive paragraphs). Then, we compute $S = QP^\\intercal$ which is a $B \\times B$ matrix of **similarity scored** between each question and paragraph. This matrix can directly be used for training: any ($q_i, p_j$) pais where $i = j$ is considered to be a positive example, while it's negative otherwise. In total there will be $B$ training instances per batch, each with $B-1$ negative passages. "

The study of their properties is known as organic chemistry and their study in the context of living organisms is known as biochemistry. By some definitions, \"organic\" compounds are only required to contain carbon. However, most of them also contain hydrogen, and because it is the carbon-hydrogen bond which gives this class of compounds most of its particular chemical characteristics, carbon-hydrogen bonds are required in some definitions of the word \"organic\" in chemistry. Millions of hydrocarbons are known, and they are usually formed by complicated synthetic pathways, which seldom involve elementary hydrogen.\n",

Hydrogen can form compounds with elements that are more electronegative, such as halogens (e.g., F, Cl, Br, I), or oxygen; in these compounds hydrogen takes on a partial positive charge. When bonded to fluorine, oxygen, or nitrogen, hydrogen can participate in a form of medium-strength noncovalent bonding with other similar molecules between their hydrogens called hydrogen bonding, which is critical to the stability of many biological molecules. Hydrogen also forms compounds with less electronegative elements, such as the metals and metalloids, in which it takes on a partial negative charge. These compounds are often known as hydrides.\n",
            "1)\tThe universal emergence of atomic hydrogen first occurred during the recombination epoch. At standard temperature and pressure, hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, nonmetallic, highly combustible diatomic gas with the molecular formula H2. Since hydrogen readily forms covalent compounds with most non-metallic elements, most of the hydrogen on Earth exists in molecular forms such as in the form of water or organic compounds. Hydrogen plays a particularly important role in acid–base reactions as many acid-base reactions involve the exchange of protons between soluble molecules. In ionic compounds, hydrogen can take the form of a negative charge (i.e., anion) when it is known as a hydride, or as a positively charged (i.e., cation) species denoted by the symbol H+. The hydrogen cation is written as though composed of a bare proton, but in reality, hydrogen cations in ionic compounds are always more complex species than that would suggest. As the only neutral atom for which the Schrödinger equation can be solved analytically, study of the energetics and bonding of the hydrogen atom has played a key role in the development of quantum mechanics.\n",
            "2)\tH2 reacts with every oxidizing element. Hydrogen can react spontaneously and violently at room temperature with chlorine and fluorine to form the corresponding hydrogen halides, hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride, which are also potentially dangerous acids.\n",
            "3)\tH2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water. The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.\n",
            "4)\tHydrogen, as atomic H, is the most abundant chemical element in the universe, making up 75% of normal matter by mass and over 90% by number of atoms (most of the mass of the universe, however, is not in the form of chemical-element type matter, but rather is postulated to occur as yet-undetected forms of mass such as dark matter and dark energy). This element is found in great abundance in stars and gas giant planets. Molecular clouds of H2 are associated with star formation. Hydrogen plays a vital role in powering stars through the proton-proton reaction and the CNO cycle nuclear fusion.\n"
